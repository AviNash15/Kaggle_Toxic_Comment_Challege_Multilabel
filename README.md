## Kaggle_Toxic_Comment_Challege_Multilabel

This repository demonstrate an example for multilabel classification.
Dataset: kaggle Toxic Comment Challenge
Implementation: Machine Learning algorithm (I have used RandomForest but you can use any other classifier such as DecisionTree, KNeighbors etc.)
I have implemented basic text preprocessing but you can do better preprocessing by using regex, ntlk etc.
